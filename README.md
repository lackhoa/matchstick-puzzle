It can solve puzzles like these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxdd24V9BZo

How to use: you only need to convert the input graph and the desired result to a list of coordinates as indicated in the main.py file. Then the program will spill out the coordinates of matchsticks that are common to both graphs. And that is basically all you need to solve the problem.

There are also a few example problems that I solved at the beginning of the file for you to test out. Enjoy!
